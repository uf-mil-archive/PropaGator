// Sending a transform with a TransformBroadcaster requires five arguments.
// First, we pass in the rotation transform, which is specified by a
// btQuaternion for any rotation that needs to occur between the two
// coordinate frames.  In this case, we want to apply no rotation, so we send
// in a btQuaternion constructed from pitch,  roll, and yaw values equal to
// zero. Second, a btVector3 for any translation that we'd like to apply. We
// do, however, want to apply a translation, so we create a btVector3
// corresponding to the laser's x offset of 10cm and z offset of 20cm from the
// robot base. Third, we need to give the transform being published a
// timestamp, we'll just stamp it with ros::Time::now(). Fourth, we need to
// pass the name of the parent node of the link we're creating, in this case
// "base_link."  Fifth, we need to pass the name of the child node of the link
// we're creating, in this case "base_laser."
